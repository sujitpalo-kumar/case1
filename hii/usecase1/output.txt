Here's an example of how you can create a Leap Year program in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Function to check if a given year is a leap year or not
function isLeapYear(year) {
  // To be a leap year, the year must be divisible by 4
  if (year % 4 === 0) {
    // If the year is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year
    if (year % 100 === 0 && year % 400 !== 0) {
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}

// Test the function
const year = 2020;
if (isLeapYear(year)) {
  console.log(year + ' is a leap year.');
} else {
  console.log(year + ' is not a leap year.');
}
```

In this program, we define a function `isLeapYear` that takes a year as input and checks if it is a leap year or not. 

To determine whether a year is a leap year, we use the following criteria:
- The year must be divisible by 4.
- If the year is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400.

We then test the function by passing a year (in this case, 2020) and log the result to the console.
