Here is an example of how you can create a sum of two numbers in JavaScript:

```javascript
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 5;

let sum = num1 + num2;

console.log(sum); // Output: 15
```

In this example, we have two variables `num1` and `num2` which hold the values `10` and `5` respectively. We then use the `+` operator to add the two numbers together and store the result in the `sum` variable.

Finally, we use the `console.log()` function to display the result, which in this case would be `15`.
